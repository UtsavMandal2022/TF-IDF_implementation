exclusive time of functions on a singlethreaded cpu we execute a program containing n functions each function has a unique id between and n function calls are stored in a call stack when a function call starts its id is pushed onto the stack and when a function call ends its id is popped off the stack the function whose id is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed each time a function starts or ends we write a log with the id whether it started or ended and the timestamp you are given a list logs where logsi represents the ith log message formatted as a string functionidstart endtimestamp for example start means a function call with function id started at the beginning of timestamp and end means a function call with function id ended at the end of timestamp note that a function can be called multiple times possibly recursively a functions exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program for example if a function is called twice one call executing for time units and another call executing for time unit the exclusive time is return the exclusive time of each function in an array where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with id i example input n logs startstartendend output explanation function starts at the beginning of time then it executes for units of time and reaches the end of time function starts at the beginning of time executes for units of time and ends at the end of time function resumes execution at the beginning of time and executes for unit of time so function spends units of total time executing and function spends units of total time executing example input n logs startstartendstartendend output explanation function starts at the beginning of time executes for units of time and recursively calls itself function recursive call starts at the beginning of time and executes for units of time function initial call resumes execution then immediately calls itself again function nd recursive call starts at the beginning of time and executes for unit of time function initial call resumes execution at the beginning of time and executes for unit of time so function spends units of total time executing example input n logs startstartendstartendend output explanation function starts at the beginning of time executes for units of time and recursively calls itself function recursive call starts at the beginning of time and executes for units of time function initial call resumes execution then immediately calls function function starts at the beginning of time executes unit of time and ends at the end of time function resumes execution at the beginning of time and executes for units of time so function spends units of total time executing and function spends unit of total time executing constraints n logslength functionid n timestamp no two start events will happen at the same timestamp no two end events will happen at the same timestamp each function has an end log for each start log
